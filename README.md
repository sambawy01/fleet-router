## Why Fleet?

A single LLM call is a guess. **Fleet is a system.**

| | Single Ollama call | Fleet |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Opinions per prompt** | 1 | up to N models x M samples |
| **Quality signal** | none | code execution / numeric vote / LLM judge |
| **Wrong-answer detection** | none | calibrated abstention |
| **Self-improvement** | none | Thompson-sampling bandit on outcomes |
| **Refinement** | none | optional critique -> revise pass |
| **Eval harness** | DIY | built-in, with regression gating |
| **Privacy** | local | local |
| **Cost** | one call | N x M calls (the trade) |

The trade: **per-prompt latency goes 5-20x and cost goes 10-50x, in exchange for measurably better answers.** If you want fast and cheap, this isn't it.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sambawy01/fleet-router.git
cd fleet-router
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Make sure Ollama is running with at least one model pulled
ollama pull deepseek-v4-pro:cloud

# Ask away
fleet "solve 2x + 5 = 13"
fleet --parallel "compare microservices vs monolith"
fleet --model glm-5.1 "write a poem about lighthouses"

# Run the eval harness
fleet --eval evals/fixtures/hard/
```

---

## Architecture

```
Prompt -> Classifier -> Router Decision -> Dispatcher -> Verifier -> Synthesizer -> Result
              |              |                |           |            |
         keywords +     confidence      parallel     per-tag     pick best
         embeddings     threshold        or single    scoring     by heuristic
```

### The synthesis layer

| Tag | Verifier | Quality Signal |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `CodeVerifier` | AST validity + (opt-in) sandboxed execution |
| `math` | `MathVerifier` | Numeric extraction + cross-sample majority vote |
| `reasoning`, `creative`, `summarize`, `translate`, `general` | `JudgeVerifier` | LLM-as-judge with tag-specific rubric |
| any (fallback) | `HeuristicVerifier` | Length / AST / diversity (legacy synthesizer) |

---

## Features

### Verifier-driven synthesis
No more "longest" or "lexically diverse" winning. Each tag has an executable or judge-based scorer. Code is AST-validated (and optionally sandbox-executed). Math runs majority vote over numeric answers. Reasoning/creative/etc. go to an LLM judge with a tag-specific rubric.

### Self-consistency sampling
Math and reasoning tags sample the same model N times (default 5 / 3) and majority-vote. On GSM8K-class problems this closes most of the gap to frontier models with the same base LLM.

### Calibrated abstention
When no candidate clears the quality bar, fleet returns a structured "I don't know -- here are the top candidates and why I can't pick" instead of a confident wrong answer.

### Disagreement escalation
Opt-in: when the verifier abstains or the winner score is weak, fleet hands all candidates to a configured stronger Ollama model for arbitration.

### Multi-pass refinement
Opt-in: critique pass identifies errors, revise pass fixes them. ~5-20pp quality lift on most tasks. Doubles latency.

### Outcome-driven bandit
Thompson-sampling Beta posteriors per `(tag, model)`. Reward = verifier/judge score (NOT latency). Persists to JSON. Learns which open-source model is actually best for *your* prompt distribution.

### Thinking-model aware
`<thinking>...</thinking>` chain-of-thought blocks are stripped before scoring AND before returning, so reasoning models aren't penalized for verbose internal reasoning and users only see the final answer.

### Eval harness with regression gating
JSONL fixtures + per-tag scorers + multi-choice + comparison harness. `fleet --eval --baseline path.json` exits non-zero on >3pp regression -- wire it into CI.

## Models

This project routes **only to open-source LLMs running on Ollama** (local or `:cloud` tags). Default config:

| Model | Best For | Ollama Tag |
|---|---|---|
| **DeepSeek V4 Pro** | Code, reasoning, math | `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` |
| **GLM 5.1** | Creative writing, Chinese, long context | `glm-5.1:cloud` |
| **MiniMax 2.7** | Summarization, dialogue | `minimax-m2.7:cloud` |
| **DeepSeek V4 Flash** | Fast drafts | `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` |

Drop in any other Ollama model -- Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS, etc. -- by adding it to `~/.fleet/config.yaml`.

> **Note:** OpenAI / Anthropic / proprietary providers are **intentionally not supported.** This is by design -- the value prop is "best outcome on open-source models."

---

## CLI

```bash
fleet "<prompt>"                        # auto-route, verifier synthesis
fleet --parallel "<prompt>"             # force parallel mode
fleet --model glm-5.1 "<prompt>"        # force a specific model
fleet --config ~/.fleet/config.yaml ...  # custom config
fleet -v "<prompt>"                      # verbose logging to stderr

# Eval harness
fleet --eval evals/fixtures/                                # run all fixtures
fleet --eval evals/fixtures/hard/                           # discriminating set
fleet --eval evals/fixtures/hard/ --save-baseline base.json # snapshot
fleet --eval evals/fixtures/hard/ --baseline base.json      # regression gate
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` error, `2` sentinel error (e.g. no model available), `3` regression detected, `130` interrupted.

---

## Python API

```python
import asyncio
from fleet import FleetRouter, load_config

router = FleetRouter(load_config())

async def main():
    answer = await router.ask("solve 5x - 3 = 12")
    print(answer)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Side-by-side comparison

```python
from evals.compare import compare

report = await compare(
    a=("baseline", baseline_router),
    b=("fleet",    fleet_router),
    fixtures_dir="evals/fixtures/hard/",
)
print(report["summary"])
```

## Configuration

Resolution order: explicit `--config` path -> `~/.fleet/config.yaml` -> bundled `fleet/config.yaml` -> built-in defaults.

  llm_model: ""                 # set to an Ollama model when mode=llm

synthesis:
  mode: verifier                # "verifier" (default) or "heuristic"

## How It Works

### Classification

Keyword regex with **saturating exponential** scoring (1 match -> 0.55, 2 -> 0.80, 3+ -> 0.91). Single accidental matches stay below the parallel-mode threshold. Optional sentence-transformer embedding adds a bounded bonus to the dominant tag. Optional `LLMClassifier` for harder cases.

### Routing Decision

| Confidence | Mode | Models Called |
|---|---|---|
| >= 0.8 | Single | 1 (best by tag, by priority OR by bandit) |
| < 0.8 or `--parallel` | Parallel | up to N models x M samples |

### Verification

Per-tag verifiers replace heuristics. `CodeVerifier` AST-walks for dangerous patterns (subprocess, eval, file I/O, network) and **refuses to execute** unsafe code even with `code_execute=true`. `MathVerifier` extracts final numeric answers (handling `\boxed{}`, "answer is X", scientific notation, decimals) and majority-votes. `JudgeVerifier` sends labeled candidates to an Ollama judge with a tag-specific rubric and parses ranked output (with JSON-extraction fallback for verbose models).

### Calibrated Abstention

When the winner's score is below `abstention_threshold` OR the verifier flags abstention, fleet returns:

```
(uncertain -- <reason>)

Top candidates considered:

--- model-a#0 (score=0.30) ---
<answer>

--- model-b#0 (score=0.30) ---
<answer>
```

Beats a confident wrong answer.

### Outcome-Driven Bandit

Thompson sampling over `(tag, model)` Beta posteriors. **Reward signal = verifier/judge score in [0,1]** -- never latency, never cost. Each sampled candidate is an independent observation, so `samples_per_model=5` gives the bandit 5x more signal per dispatch. State persists atomically to `~/.fleet/bandit.json`. With bandit enabled, the router Thompson-ranks the **full** tag-matching pool (not just `max_parallel` head-of-line candidates) so it can explore.

---

## Eval Harness

Fixtures are JSONL -- one case per line. Each gets routed through fleet and scored by a tag-default or per-case scorer.

```jsonl
{"tag": "code", "prompt": "Write merge_intervals(intervals)", "test_code": "assert merge_intervals([[1,3],[2,6]]) == [[1,6]]"}
{"tag": "math", "prompt": "What is gcd(252, 105)?", "expected": 21}
{"tag": "reasoning", "scorer": "multi_choice", "prompt": "...\n(A) ... (B) ...", "expected": "B"}
```

Built-in scorers:

| Scorer | Score = | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `CodeExecScorer` | 1.0 if `code + test_code` exits 0, else 0.0 | code |
| `NumericMatchScorer` | 1.0 if final number matches `expected` (rel-tol) | math |
| `MultipleChoiceScorer` | 1.0 if extracted A/B/C/D/E matches | reasoning (MMLU-style) |
| `KeywordContainsScorer` | fraction of expected keywords present | summarize, creative, general |

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/                # 189 passing, 1 skipped
pytest tests/verifiers/      # verifier framework
pytest tests/evals/          # harness + scorers
```

189 tests cover providers, verifiers (code/math/judge/heuristic), self-consistency, escalation, refinement, abstention, bandit (selection + posterior updates + persistence), event bus, LLM classifier, retrieval, eval harness + comparison harness, CLI (including eval subcommand), and config validation. The 1 skipped test runs only when `sentence-transformers` is installed.
